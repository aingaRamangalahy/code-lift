# Codelift Backend API Specification

## Overview

Codelift is a website that aims to help individuals learn coding by sharing learning resources such as tutorials, articles, videos, and more. This document outlines the specifications for the backend API of the Codelift website, which will be built using Node.js.

## Authentication

The API will support user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Users will be able to register, login, and logout from the website. Certain endpoints will require authentication to access, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources.

## Error Handling

The API should handle various error scenarios and provide appropriate error responses with status codes and error messages.

## Security

The API should implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access, protect user data, and prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.

## Testing

The API should be thoroughly tested using unit tests and integration tests to ensure its functionality and reliability.

## Deployment

The API should be deployed on a server with appropriate infrastructure to handle traffic efficiently.

## Documentation

The API should be well-documented with detailed explanations of each endpoint, request parameters, request bodies, and responses. API documentation will help developers understand how to use the API effectively.
